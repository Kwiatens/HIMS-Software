HIMS is a lightweight, open-source, terminal based Hardware Inventory Management System. It keeps track of all the hardware parts you own, alerts you when a part is running out/is out of stock, includes a label printer automation for 'HIMS Scan R1', which allows rapid and easy changes to the part quantity without needing to constantly type stuff on the PC. 

It is ideal for people who design/assemble PCBs or hardware projects.

## Features
- Keeps track of all your parts and their quantity.
- Low/out of stock warnings.
- Features a DigiKey API integration to display all the parameters about a part.
- Order import (CSV) from DigiKey.
- ZPL Label printer integration for custom 'HIMS labels' for use with 'HIMS Scan' device.
- Filters instantly by keyword, category, tag, parameter, quantity, SKU, status, or location.
- Lets you adjust stock, edit item records, and open store or datasheet links.
- Hosts a local scanner page for mobile DigiKey 2D code intake if you haven't build a 'HIMS Scan'

## Future plans
- HIMS Scanner Hardware.
- Integration with more components stores.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

If you want to launch the executable directly, it will usually be in `build\Debug\hims.exe`.

## Tests

```bash
cmake --build build --target hims_tests
build\Debug\hims_tests.exe
```
